Caternator Grammar
==================

Hopefully this is a useful guide on how to write for the Caternator of Strings.

The grammar that the Caternator uses is meant to be (mostly) regularized, and pretty easy to understand.  If you've ever used Inform 7, you might recognize a few things.  But it's mostly not like Inform at all, so I guess that doesn't really help.

As far as feeding it input from an app, really all you need to do is stick all your input together into one giant string (with items separated by new-lines) and feed it into the parser.
